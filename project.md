# Project 1

## Description

This project aims to solidify the basic skills in using Github as a collaborative tool to enage with for the rest of the class and onwards.
As part of the project, we have created different repositories - one individual and one collaborative.
Finally, we are creating a personal webpage that we will be using to showcase our work!
