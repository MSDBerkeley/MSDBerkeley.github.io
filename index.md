## Profile: 

MPA Candidate at the Goldman School of Public Policy, UC Berkeley, focused on understanding the development paradox. I also enjoy sitting outside, people-watching, and enjoying a good cup of coffee with some chocolate.

I'm half-Colombian, half-German, and grew up in Costa Rica. As a migrant, I’ve always been drawn to understanding the deep-rooted issues in our society, particularly socio-environmental conflicts. I have a deep love for Latin America, its vibrant colors—from black to green to brown—and for its people, landscapes, flowers, oceans, rivers, and mountains.

Currently, I'm exploring how to leverage private-sector resources to accelerate the deployment of Tech for Good initiatives.
